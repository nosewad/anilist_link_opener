# anilist link opener

If you keep an anime list in a text file, you can use this script to open an anilist.co link for each line of that text file. 
This script will ask for the file location and how many tabs you would like it to open at once (I recommend 10). After that, it'll open that many tabs, ask if you would like to continue, and open another batch of however many you entered.

Only tested with Python 3.13.
